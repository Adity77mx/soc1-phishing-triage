# üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Triage Investigation Report

> An interactive phishing email triage investigation simulation inspired by real SOC tasks and TryHackMe-style guided challenges.

---

## üìÑ About

This project simulates the real-life workflow of a SOC Level 1 Analyst during a **phishing triage** investigation. You will be given a **suspicious email**, and your task is to analyze the evidence, extract IoCs, and answer guided questions to identify the threat.

---

## üì• Provided Evidence

- **Suspicious Email Screenshot** (`.png`)
- **Email Header** (`.eml`)
- **Raw Message Body HTML** (`.html`)
- **Phishing Link/URL Sample** (`.txt`)
- **Rendered Phishing Page** (`.png`)
- **Loki Scan Output** (`.txt`)

## üîç Investigation Sections

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Header Analysis

> Inspect the sender's email header to identify source IP, sender domain, mail server hops, and possible spoofing.

**Key Points:**
- Look for suspicious IPs and sender mismatch
- Check SPF, DKIM, and DMARC status
- Review "Return-Path" and "Reply-To" headers

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ URL/Link Analysis

> Analyze the malicious link(s) and investigate whether it's a phishing site, C2, or credential harvester.

**Key Points:**
- Identify if the URL uses punycode or domain impersonation
- Look for URL shortening or redirection
- Investigate final domain using VirusTotal, URLScan, etc.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Loki Scan Results

> Investigate the malware dropped from the phishing link using `Loki Scanner` output.

**Example Questions You‚Äôll Face:**
- What is the filename and classification?
- Which YARA rule matched?
- Was a known web shell detected?
- How many suspicious strings?
