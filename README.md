# 🛡️ Phishing Email Triage Report (SOC Level 1 Portfolio)

A complete investigation walkthrough of a suspicious phishing email, analyzed from a SOC Level 1 perspective.  
This project mimics how an entry-level security analyst would triage and report phishing threats inside a SOC environment.

## 📌 Summary

This report demonstrates the **triage** process of a real-world suspicious email using open-source tools, threat intelligence, and manual analysis.

The key objectives:
- Identify phishing indicators
- Perform header analysis
- Check URLs/domains
- Map behavior to MITRE ATT&CK
- Provide risk score and recommendations

## 📂 Report Contents

- Overview of the incident
- Technical indicators of phishing
- Visual snapshots of analysis steps
- MITRE mapping to `T1566.001` (Spearphishing via Email)
- Final summary + risk rating

---

## 📘 Why This Matters

This type of investigation is a **day-one task** for entry-level SOC Analysts.  
This report shows you're capable of:

- Reading between the lines of suspicious emails
- Using public tools like `MXToolbox`, `VirusTotal`, and header parsers
- Explaining findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add `.eml` file parsing via Python
- Automate IOC extraction
- Connect to Splunk or a SIEM simulator
