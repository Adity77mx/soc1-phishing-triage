## 📘 Why This Matters

This type of investigation is a **day-one task** for entry-level SOC Analysts.  
This report shows you're capable of:

- Reading between the lines of suspicious emails
- Using public tools like `MXToolbox`, `VirusTotal`, and header parsers
- Explaining findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add `.eml` file parsing via Python
- Automate IOC extraction
- Connect to Splunk or a SIEM simulator
