# 🛡️ SOC1 Phishing Triage

A hands-on phishing investigation mini-lab built to simulate real-world SOC Level 1 triage. Analyze a phishing email sample, extract IOCs, evaluate headers, and follow a structured workflow — all in one place.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To train SOC L1 aspirants in realistic phishing triage using evidence files (.eml, screenshots, markdown guides). This is part of a cybersecurity portfolio project.
